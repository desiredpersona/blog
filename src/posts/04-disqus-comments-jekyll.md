The Disqus comments plug-in allows you to engage with the audience of your static website, without the hassle of maintaining a server.

You can sign up for a [Disqus account here](https://disqus.com){rel="nofollow"} if you haven't already.

Next register your website with Disqus by creating a unique [Disqus shortname](https://help.disqus.com/installation/whats-a-shortname){rel="nofollow"}.

Open your Jekyll sites `config.yml` file and add the following code. Remember to change `my_disqus_shortname` below which is just a placeholder for your own websites unique Disqus shortname that you created earlier.

```yaml
# Disqus Comments
disqus:
  # Leave shortname blank to disable comments site-wide.
  # Disable comments for any post by adding `comments: false` to that post's YAML Front Matter.
  shortname: my_disqus_shortname
```

Create a file called `disqus_comments.html` in Jekyll’s `_includes` folder and add the following code and save the file.

```js
{% raw %}{% if page.comments != false and jekyll.environment == "production" %}{% endraw %}

  <div id="disqus_thread"></div>
  <script>
    var disqus_config = function () {
      this.page.url = '{% raw %}{{ page.url | absolute_url }}{% endraw %}';
      this.page.identifier = '{% raw %}{{ page.url | absolute_url }}{% endraw %}';
    };
    (function() {
      var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');
      s.src = 'https://{% raw %}{{ site.disqus.shortname }}{% endraw %}.disqus.com/embed.js';
      s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date());
      (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);
    })();
  </script>
  <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript" rel="nofollow">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript>
{% raw %}{% endif %}{% endraw %}
```

The above codeblock includes your [ Disqus Universal Embed Code](https://disqus.com/admin/universalcode/){rel="nofollow"}. You may have noticed that I wrapped the code between `{% raw %}{% if page.comments != false and jekyll.environment == "production" %}{% endraw %}` and `{% raw %}{% endif %}{% endraw %}` liquid if statement. This included if statement will allow you to disable Disqus comments on any blog post. You simply add `comments: false` in that posts [YAML front-matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/). As an added bonus it will also prevent Disqus loading when Jekyll's environment is set to development.

Finally, open your posts layout file normally called `post.html` which is located in your `_layouts` folder and add the following liquid include tag just after the end `</article>` tag. This will load Disqus comments right underneath your blog posts when Jekyll's environment is set to production.

```liquid
{% raw %}{% if site.disqus.shortname %}
  {% include disqus_comments.html %}
{% endif %}{% endraw %}
```

To build your Jekyll site in production environment use the following command.

```shell
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build
```

Done!

Your Disqus comment system should now be working correctly after you push these changes to your live website.
